# Introduction
[**SOLID**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles are intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable
Here I try to explain each one of them with examples in **javascript** language

*Note : It's advised to check them in order*
# SOLID Principles :
- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://github.com/SamehEtman/SOLID-Principles-JS/tree/master/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle)
- [Open closed Principle (OCP)](https://github.com/SamehEtman/SOLID-Principles-JS/tree/master/Open%20Closed%20Principle)
- [Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)](https://github.com/SamehEtman/SOLID-Principles-JS/tree/master/Liskov%20Substitution%20principle)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](https://github.com/SamehEtman/SOLID-Principles-JS/tree/master/Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle)
