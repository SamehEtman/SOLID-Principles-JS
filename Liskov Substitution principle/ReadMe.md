# Definition :
Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
# Problem statement :
We want to make a rectangle class and another square class and we want both of them to have the same methods which are get,set width/height and calculating the area

# Abstraction : 
1. Make a Reatagle class with the mentioned proprities
2. Make a Square class with the mentioned proprities

# Bad Approach :
Ok , it's mentined in the statement that both of the classes shares the same proprities, so i will make a class Rectangle and make a subclass Square that inherits from it and as we studied before a square is rectangle with height = width so this should be ok
```js
class Rectangle {
  // the _ before the variable name is a convintion
  // that this variable should be private
  // in es6 the # identifier was inroduced
  // to define private variable but it's not supported
  // in node js still
  constructor(width, height) {
    this._width = width;
    this._height = height;
  }
  set width(w) {
    this._width = w;
  }
  get width() {
    return this._width;
  }
  set height(h) {
    this._height = h;
  }
  get height() {
    return this._height;
  }
  get area() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }
  toString() {
    return `${this._width}×${this._height}`;
  }
}
```
ok that's the recatngle on the square we go :
```js
class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(size) {
    super(size, size);
  }
}
```
now let's see what we get when test that
```js
let rc = new Rectangle(2, 3);
console.log(rc.toString())
let sq = new Square(5);
console.log(sq.toString())
```
```bash
2×3
5×5
```
ok that looks good but what if we tried to do something like modifying the square width like this
``` js
let rc = new Rectangle(2, 3);
console.log(rc.toString())
let sq = new Square(5);
sq.width = 1;
console.log(sq.toString())
```
``` bash
2×3
1×5
```
Huh... , thats a little problem we can fix it by adding setters and getters for the square class like that
```js
class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(size) {
    super(size, size);
  }
  set width(value) {
    this._width = this._height = value;
  }
  get width() {
    return this._width;
  }
  set height(value) {
    this._width = this._height = value;
  }
  get height() {
    return this._height;
  }
}
```
*Note : if you defined only the set function, the get function won't  propagate from the parent so it's better to define setter too*
Now It's ouputs the desirable result
```bash
2×3
1×1
```
Let's define a function that takes a rectangle and set its height to 10 then console.log its area 
note that it should be ok to pass a square to that function as it a subclass so it should work without a problem
```js
const logArea = function(rect)
{
  let width = rect._width;
  rect.height = 10; // set its height to 10
  console.log(
    `Expected area of ${10*width}, ` +
    `got ${rect.area}`
  );
};

let rc = new Rectangle(2,3);
logArea(rc);

let sq = new Square(5);
logArea(sq);
```
```bash
Expected area of 20, got 20
Expected area of 50, got 100
```
Huh ,,, As you can see when we pass a square it doesn't behave as we meant the function to be, It looks like the function is specially made for rectangles only and we **can't substitute it with its sub class**  Square
# Better Approach :
As we saw in the previous approach it's a bad thing to use inheritance in this example so a good approach is to just make them seperate classes
```js 
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this._width = width;
    this._height = height;
  }
  set width(w) {
    this._width = w;
  }
  get width() {
    return this._width;
  }
  set height(h) {
    this._height = h;
  }
  get height() {
    return this._height;
  }
  get area() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }
  toString() {
    return `${this._width}×${this._height}`;
  }
}
class Square  {
  constructor(size) {
    this._size = size;
  }
  set size(value) {
    this._size  = value;
  }
  get size() {
    return this._size;
  }
  get area (){
      return this._size * this._size;
  }
  toString() {
    return `${this._size}×${this._size}`;
  }
}
```
